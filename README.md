# Programming-Portfolio
This is a collection of programs I had worked to create, modify, and augment during the Summer of 2015 and 3D models I had created during my 2016 Summer; most of this code was created as I followed along the MIT 61a course, so any further details about each program can be found on their Summer 2015 CS 61a website. There are still bugs in some programs, some programs are only partially functional, and some of the code is reference and source code. Otherwise this is the fruits of my labor that demonstrate my programming knowledge. I would recommend looking at analogclock.py (creates an analog clock in a separate window when run), digclock.py(creates a digital clock in a separate window), and tetris_template_true.py(the classic game of tetris). The 3D models were created to be apart of a few videogames I had helped create during my 2016 Summer at Carnegie Mellon University. The main player model (gamecharacter.fbx) I had built was rigged and animated for one of the games we built. There are also many models and animations of the different iterations I had made for another game(the game full game is in finalproject.exe).
