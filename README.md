# Programming-Portfolio
This is a collection of programs I had worked to create, modify, and augment during the Summer of 2015; most of this code was created as I followed along the MIT 61a course, so any further details about each program can be found on their Summer 2015 CS 61a website. There are still bugs in some programs, some programs are only partially functional, and some of the code is reference and source code. Otherwise this is the fruits of my labor that demonstrate my programming knowledge. I would recommend looking at analogclock.py (creates an analog clock in a separate window when run), digclock.py(creates a digital clock in a separate window), tetris_template_true.py(the classic game of tetris), and TESTING.
